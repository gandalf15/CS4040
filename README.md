# Latency Performance Comparison of Open Source Real-Time Publish-Subscribe Data Distribution Service Implementations by Marcel Zak

Abstract: I performed an empirical evaluation of latency performance of two popular open source implemen-
tations of RTPS DDS protocol. Those two libraries were eProsima Fast RTPS and OpenDDS. The presented re-
sults clearly show that eProsima Fast RTPS is two times faster in terms of latency performance than OpenDDS.
This was confirmed with both, ”Best effort” and ”Reliable”, transport types.
